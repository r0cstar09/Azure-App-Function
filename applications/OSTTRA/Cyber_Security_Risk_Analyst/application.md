## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Risk Analyst position at OSTTRA. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in analyzing cyber risk, supporting process improvement, and safeguarding sensitive systems and data.

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments where understanding risk, prioritizing security issues, and coordinating with multiple teams were critical. From enterprise SOC operations to public-sector security monitoring and threat intelligence analysis, my roles have required me to assess the impact of threats and vulnerabilities and communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This experience aligns well with OSTTRA’s mission to protect critical financial systems and data.

I am particularly drawn to this role’s focus on coordination, analysis, and continuous improvement. I have consistently supported structured security processes, contributed to post-incident reviews, and helped refine security operations to better align with organizational risk and compliance expectations.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my analytical mindset, security operations background, and collaborative approach to OSTTRA’s cyber security team. Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your organization.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
