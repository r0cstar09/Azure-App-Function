## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Risk Analyst role at OSTTRA. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, risk-focused approach to cybersecurity that aligns well with the needs of a financial services environment.

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations by identifying security risks, assessing threat activity, and contributing to processes that reduce exposure to cyber threats. My experience spans frontline SOC operations, detailed incident investigations, and intelligence analysis designed to inform both tactical and strategic decision making. This progression has given me a strong understanding of how day-to-day security events translate into enterprise risk.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on translating complex threat activity into actionable insights that support defensive planning and risk awareness. Previously, in security analyst and incident response roles, I worked closely with monitoring, vulnerability management, and response processes—helping organizations prioritize remediation efforts and improve their overall security posture.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at OSTTRA due to its emphasis on safeguarding sensitive financial data and coordinating security activities across teams. I enjoy working in collaborative environments and contributing to continuous process improvement, and I am excited about the opportunity to apply my background in support of OSTTRA’s risk management objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can contribute to your cybersecurity team.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
