## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position at Alteo. With more than eight years of experience across Security Operations Centers, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a well‑rounded operational perspective well suited to supporting and evolving a SOC environment.

Throughout my career, I have worked in roles directly supporting SOC monitoring, incident investigation, and response workflows. Starting as a SOC Analyst and progressing into incident response and threat intelligence, I have been consistently involved in helping organizations detect, analyze, and manage security incidents while improving overall defensive visibility. My experience includes contributing to detection scenarios, aligning monitoring activities with known adversary techniques, and supporting continuous improvement of security operations.

In my most recent roles, I have worked closely with SOC and response teams to translate threat intelligence into practical operational value. This includes mapping threats to monitored behaviors, supporting incident investigations, and producing clear technical and executive‑level reporting to guide security decisions. I am particularly interested in roles where I can contribute to building and maturing SOC capabilities in a structured, risk‑aligned manner.

Alteo’s focus on developing and managing SOC operations strongly aligns with my background and professional interests. I am motivated by opportunities where I can help strengthen incident management processes while supporting an organization’s broader security posture.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could support Alteo’s security operations.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
