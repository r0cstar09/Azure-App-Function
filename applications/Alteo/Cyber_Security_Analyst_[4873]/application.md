## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position at Alteo. With over eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have spent my career supporting and improving security monitoring, detection, and response capabilities in both public and private sector environments.

Throughout my roles, I have worked closely with SOC and incident response teams to triage alerts, investigate security incidents, and refine monitoring scenarios to better align with organizational risk. My background includes contributing to detection logic, response playbooks, and post-incident reporting—core elements required to successfully stand up and manage a Security Operations Center.

I bring a practical understanding of how SOC functions evolve, from foundational monitoring and alert handling to more mature intelligence-driven detection and response. I am comfortable collaborating with technical teams as well as communicating security findings in a clear and actionable way to leadership, supporting informed decision-making and long-term security posture improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and help Alteo continue to strengthen its cybersecurity operations. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
