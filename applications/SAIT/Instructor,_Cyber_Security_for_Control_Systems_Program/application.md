## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Committee,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Instructor position for the Cyber Security for Control Systems program at SAIT. With over eight years of hands‑on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring both practical cybersecurity expertise and the ability to communicate complex concepts in a clear, structured manner suited to post‑diploma learners.

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments where availability, resilience, and risk management are critical. My experience spans security monitoring, vulnerability management, incident investigation, and threat analysis—skills that directly support the foundational and defensive principles required to protect operational and control system environments. I regularly align technical activity with frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and industry standards, ensuring that security concepts are understandable, repeatable, and relevant to real‑world scenarios.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I translate emerging threats into actionable insights for security and leadership teams. Previously, as an Incident Responder and SOC Analyst, I supported detection and response operations that required disciplined processes, clear documentation, and effective communication under pressure. These experiences have strengthened my ability to teach cybersecurity not just as theory, but as applied practice grounded in operational realities.

I am particularly motivated by SAIT’s focus on future‑forward technical education and preparing students for real‑world challenges. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Cyber Security for Control Systems program by helping students understand defensive strategies, incident response processes, and risk‑based security decision‑making within critical and industrial environments.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and teaching approach can contribute to SAIT and the CSCS program.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
