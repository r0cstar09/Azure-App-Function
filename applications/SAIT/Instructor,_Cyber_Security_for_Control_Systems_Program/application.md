## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Instructor, Cyber Security for Control Systems position at SAIT. With over eight years of professional experience in security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong applied foundation in cybersecurity principles that align well with the goals of the Cyber Security for Control Systems post-diploma program.

Throughout my career, I have worked across SOC, incident response, and intelligence roles, progressing from frontline analysis to leading investigations and developing intelligence that supports defensive decision-making. My experience has required a deep understanding of how security controls, monitoring, and response processes function in real-world operational environments—experience that translates naturally into teaching applied cybersecurity concepts to learners preparing to protect critical and operational systems.

I have consistently focused on translating complex technical findings into clear, actionable insights for a range of audiences, including security practitioners and executive stakeholders. This aligns closely with SAIT’s applied learning model and its emphasis on preparing students for practical, in-demand roles. My background in security frameworks, incident handling, and risk-based analysis allows me to contribute meaningfully to instruction that emphasizes both theory and real-world application.

I am particularly drawn to SAIT’s forward-looking approach to technology education and its focus on preparing students for the challenges of securing modern, complex environments. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my professional experience and communication skills to support the development of the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background could support the Cyber Security for Control Systems program.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
