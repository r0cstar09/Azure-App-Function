## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Team at Nokia,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Dome Test Engineer Student opportunity with Nokia. While my background is rooted in professional security operations rather than a traditional student placement, the responsibilities outlined for this role align strongly with my hands-on experience testing, validating, and improving security controls in real-world environments.

Across roles in threat intelligence, incident response, and SOC operations, I have worked closely with engineers and analysts to understand how systems behave under adversarial conditions. This experience has required a testing-oriented mindset: verifying detections, identifying weaknesses, validating remediation efforts, and providing clear feedback that supports secure development and operational improvement. These are skills that naturally translate into a security testing and engineering-focused environment such as the Cyber Security Dome.

I bring a collaborative approach, strong analytical skills, and the ability to communicate technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am particularly motivated by environments where security is integrated early into development and continuously tested against evolving threat scenarios.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience, learn from Nokia’s engineering teams, and support the development and validation of secure applications and services. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
