## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Sr. Developer (IAM) position at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a security-first mindset grounded in understanding how identity and access weaknesses are exploited in real-world environments.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with engineering, SOC, and incident response teams to investigate account compromise, authentication abuse, and privilege escalation. These experiences have given me a strong practical understanding of identity-related risk, control validation, and how defensive capabilities should be designed to scale within complex enterprise environments. My current work in threat intelligence further strengthens my ability to translate adversary behavior into actionable improvements for access control and detection strategies.

Rogers’ focus on large-scale, high-impact technology aligns closely with my background supporting complex enterprise environments and producing security insights that inform both technical teams and leadership. I am particularly drawn to this role’s opportunity to influence identity security as part of a broader, forward-looking cybersecurity program.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience investigating identity-driven attacks and supporting secure operations can contribute to Rogers’ IAM initiatives. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
