## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Sr. Developer (IAM) role at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong practical understanding of how identity and access controls are targeted, misused, and defended within complex enterprise environments.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC, incident response, and security engineering teams to investigate unauthorized access, credential misuse, and access-driven attack paths. These experiences have required a deep understanding of authentication flows, policy enforcement, and the relationship between identity systems and overall organizational risk. In both public- and private-sector environments, I have supported secure access initiatives by aligning monitoring, response, and intelligence efforts with business and security objectives.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I assess adversary techniques with a strong focus on access enablement and credential abuse, delivering actionable insights that help security teams strengthen preventive and detective controls. Previously, as an Incident Responder and SOC Analyst, I handled real-world incidents where identity systems were central to containment and recovery, reinforcing the importance of resilient IAM programs.

Rogers’ commitment to large-scale, high-impact technology initiatives across Canada strongly resonates with me. I am motivated by work that supports critical infrastructure and protects millions of users, and I am eager to contribute my security operations background to IAM-focused development and improvement efforts within your Technology team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can support Rogers’ cybersecurity and identity security goals.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
