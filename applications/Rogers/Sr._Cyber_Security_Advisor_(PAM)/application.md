## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Advisor (PAM) position at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong advisory mindset focused on reducing access-related risk and strengthening enterprise security controls.

Throughout my career, I have supported large, complex environments where improper access and credential misuse posed significant risk. From investigating compromised accounts to assessing threat actor techniques involving privilege escalation, my roles have consistently required an understanding of how access, identity, and controls intersect with organizational risk. This experience enables me to contribute meaningfully to Privileged Access Management initiatives, even where the role demands cross-team coordination and strategic guidance in addition to technical insight.

In analyst and responder roles, I have worked closely with senior stakeholders, SOC teams, and IT partners to translate security findings into practical recommendations. I am comfortable advising on security posture, policy alignment, and control effectiveness, ensuring that defensive measures scale with business needs.

Rogers’ commitment to protecting services relied upon by millions of Canadians resonates strongly with me. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my operational background and advisory perspective to your Technology team, contributing to the continued maturity of your cybersecurity program.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support Rogers’ security objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
