## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Advisor (PAM) role at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have supported organizations in protecting critical systems, managing access-related risk, and responding to high-impact security events.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC, incident response, and security leadership teams to identify and mitigate threats involving compromised credentials, unauthorized access, and misuse of elevated privileges. As an Incident Responder and SOC Analyst in large-scale environments, I regularly investigated access-driven incidents and provided guidance to reduce privilege abuse and strengthen security controls. More recently, my work in threat intelligence has focused on understanding adversary access techniques and translating that insight into practical defensive recommendations.

I bring a strong understanding of how privileged access risk intersects with governance, operational continuity, and enterprise security strategy. I am comfortable advising both technical teams and leadership, producing clear documentation, and aligning security initiatives with organizational priorities.

Rogers’ scale and commitment to securing services relied on by millions of Canadians is particularly compelling to me. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and perspective to your team and help strengthen privileged access security across the organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with this role.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
