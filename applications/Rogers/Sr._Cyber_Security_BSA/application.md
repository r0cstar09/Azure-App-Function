## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security BSA role at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a balanced perspective that aligns technical cybersecurity analysis with business-driven decision making.  

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC teams, incident responders, and leadership to analyze cyber risks, assess impacts, and translate complex technical findings into clear, actionable insights. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding evolving threat activity and framing that intelligence in a way that supports prioritization, planning, and strategic defense—skills that closely align with the expectations of a senior business security analyst.  

Previously, my work in incident response and security analysis has required close collaboration with diverse stakeholders, structured documentation, and alignment with recognized frameworks and standards. I am comfortable operating in high-visibility environments where clear communication, sound analysis, and risk-based recommendations are essential to successful outcomes.  

Rogers’ scale and commitment to delivering reliable, secure technology to millions of Canadians strongly resonates with me. I am motivated by opportunities where cybersecurity analysis directly supports business objectives and helps enable secure innovation. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience and analytical approach to Rogers’ Technology team.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background could contribute to this role.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
