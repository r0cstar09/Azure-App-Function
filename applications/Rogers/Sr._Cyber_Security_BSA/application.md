## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security BSA position at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong ability to translate cybersecurity risks and technical findings into clear, actionable insights that support business goals and large-scale technology initiatives.  

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with both technical teams and leadership to assess threats, evaluate control effectiveness, and communicate security posture in a way that supports informed decision-making. My recent work in threat intelligence involves analyzing adversary behavior and mapping it to frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, ensuring stakeholders understand not only how threats operate, but why they matter to the organization.  

In municipal and enterprise environments, I have supported vulnerability management, policy enforcement, and incident handling within regulated settings. These experiences strengthened my ability to align security requirements with organizational risk, compliance expectations, and operational realities—skills that directly support the Business Systems Analyst function within cybersecurity.  

Rogers’ scale, visibility, and impact across Canada are particularly compelling. I am motivated by opportunities where security insights contribute directly to resilient systems and trusted services for millions of users. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my analytical, communication, and security expertise to Rogers’ Technology team.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support this role.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
