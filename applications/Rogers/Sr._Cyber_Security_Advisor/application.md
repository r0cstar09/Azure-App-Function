Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and risk-focused perspective to cybersecurity that aligns well with a large, complex enterprise environment.

My career progression has allowed me to support and advise organizations across consulting, managed services, and public-sector settings. In these roles, I have worked closely with security operations teams to assess threats, support incident response, and communicate risk in a way that enables informed decision-making by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am experienced in translating evolving threat activity into actionable insights that strengthen defensive posture and operational resilience.

At One Arrow Consulting, I currently support intelligence-driven security operations by analyzing threat actors, emerging campaigns, and attacker behaviors. Previously, my roles at the City of St. John’s, Cisco Security, and Symantec exposed me to enterprise-scale environments where operational reliability, stakeholder communication, and continuous improvement were critical. These experiences have shaped my ability to advise teams under pressure while keeping long-term risk and business impact in focus.

Rogers’ scale, visibility, and role in connecting Canadians strongly appeal to me. I am motivated by opportunities where cybersecurity directly supports critical services and large user bases. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to Rogers’ Technology team and support the organization’s continued commitment to secure, reliable connectivity.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Rogers’ cybersecurity objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
