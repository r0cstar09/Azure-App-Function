## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Advisor position at Rogers. With over eight years of experience spanning SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and advisory-focused perspective to cybersecurity that aligns well with Rogers’ scale, complexity, and mission-critical services.

Throughout my career, I have supported large and diverse environments where security decisions must balance operational risk, business impact, and long-term resilience. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I provide intelligence-driven guidance to security teams and leadership, helping translate real-world threat activity into actionable defensive priorities. Previously, my work in municipal government and global incident response environments strengthened my ability to assess risk, advise stakeholders, and support structured security programs.

I am particularly drawn to this role due to Rogers’ focus on large-scale, high-visibility technology initiatives that serve millions of Canadians. I am comfortable working across technical and non-technical teams, producing clear security insights, and contributing to governance, policy alignment, and continuous improvement of security posture.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my operational background, analytical mindset, and advisory approach to Rogers’ Technology team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
