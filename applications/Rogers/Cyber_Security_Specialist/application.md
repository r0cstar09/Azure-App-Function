## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist role at Rogers. With more than eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have built a strong foundation supporting enterprise environments where availability, reliability, and risk management are critical.

Throughout my career, I have worked in SOC, IR, and intelligence-focused roles, supporting organizations by detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats while continuously improving defensive operations. My experience ranges from frontline monitoring and escalation within a SOC, to dedicated incident response for global clients, and most recently, delivering actionable threat intelligence to guide security decision-making. This progression has given me a strong appreciation for how security operations must align with business objectives and large-scale, high-visibility technology environments.

I am particularly drawn to Rogers due to the scale and impact of its technology footprint and its role in connecting Canadians nationwide. I am comfortable working within complex environments, collaborating across teams, and translating security findings into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I bring a practical, risk-informed approach to security that supports resilience and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to the Rogers Technology team and to support the ongoing protection of critical services and infrastructure. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
