## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at Rogers. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a well‑rounded cybersecurity background aligned with the needs of a large, highly visible enterprise organization.

Throughout my career, I have supported complex environments ranging from managed security providers and global technology companies to public sector organizations. These roles have strengthened my ability to operate effectively within structured security programs, collaborate across technical teams, and align security activities with organizational risk and operational priorities.

My experience in SOC operations and incident response has provided a strong foundation in monitoring, investigation, and escalation processes, while my more recent work in threat intelligence has enhanced my ability to translate emerging threats into actionable insights. I am particularly drawn to this role at Rogers due to the scale of its technology environment and its impact on Canadians nationwide.

I am motivated by opportunities to contribute to resilient security operations, support large‑scale infrastructure, and continuously improve defensive capabilities. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience and commitment to security excellence to the Rogers Technology team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Rogers’ cybersecurity goals.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
