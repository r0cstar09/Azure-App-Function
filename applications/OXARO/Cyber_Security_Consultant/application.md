## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Consultant opportunity with OXARO. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, consulting-focused perspective to helping organizations strengthen their security posture.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in consulting, enterprise, and public-sector environments, supporting clients and internal stakeholders during both proactive security initiatives and high-pressure incident scenarios. My progression from SOC analyst to incident responder and threat intelligence analyst reflects a strong foundation in detection and response, paired with the ability to translate complex technical risk into clear, actionable guidance.  

I am particularly drawn to advisory and subcontract-based engagements where professionalism, reliability, and timely delivery are critical. I am comfortable working independently or as part of a distributed team, contributing clear analysis, structured recommendations, and well-communicated outcomes.  

I would welcome the opportunity to support OXARO’s upcoming projects and contribute my experience to client-facing cybersecurity initiatives. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
