## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Specialist role with AtkinsRéalis. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in providing practical security oversight and risk-informed guidance for complex, mission‑critical environments.

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations responsible for essential services by monitoring security posture, responding to incidents, and translating technical findings into actionable recommendations for both technical teams and leadership. My experience within public sector, consulting, and enterprise security operations has required balancing operational reliability with evolving cyber threats—a challenge central to protecting transportation and critical infrastructure systems.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding adversary behaviors and emerging threats to help organizations anticipate and mitigate risk. Previously, in security operations and incident response roles, I worked hands-on with detection, escalation, and coordinated response efforts, reinforcing my ability to assess impact and guide effective remediation under pressure.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at AtkinsRéalis because of its focus on critical transportation systems and long-term infrastructure resilience. I am motivated to contribute my cybersecurity expertise, risk-oriented mindset, and communication skills to support industrial and operational stakeholders in making informed security decisions.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support AtkinsRéalis’ industrial cybersecurity objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
