## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Specialist role with AtkinsRéalis. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in assessing cyber risk and supporting secure, resilient operational environments within both public sector and enterprise contexts.

Throughout my career, I have worked in roles that required close alignment between technical security activities and organizational risk objectives. My experience conducting threat analysis, supporting incident investigations, and contributing to vulnerability management has equipped me to provide meaningful security oversight for complex systems. I am particularly drawn to this role due to its focus on critical infrastructure and the opportunity to support long-term, mission-critical transportation systems.

I am comfortable working with diverse stakeholders, translating technical security findings into clear, actionable guidance for operations teams and leadership. This approach has allowed me to effectively contribute to security decision-making, process improvement, and risk awareness across the organizations I have supported.

AtkinsRéalis’ commitment to transforming and strengthening industrial cybersecurity capabilities strongly aligns with my professional background and interests. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my operational security experience, analytical mindset, and collaborative approach to your team in Ottawa.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to the continued success of AtkinsRéalis.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
