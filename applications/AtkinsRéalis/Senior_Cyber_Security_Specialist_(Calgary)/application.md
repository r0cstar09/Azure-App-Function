## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Specialist role at AtkinsRéalis. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and disciplined approach to supporting cyber risk management in environments where reliability, safety, and resilience are critical.

My background includes supporting public-sector and enterprise operations, where security programs must balance operational continuity with evolving cyber threats. In recent roles, I have focused on providing actionable security oversight, producing clear intelligence and incident reporting, and working closely with technical and non-technical stakeholders to improve defensive posture. This experience aligns closely with the needs of critical transportation and industrial environments that demand strong governance, situational awareness, and risk-informed decision-making.

At both municipal and consulting organizations, I have supported security monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response activities tied to high-impact services. I am accustomed to working within structured frameworks and contributing to continuous improvement efforts that strengthen long-term resilience rather than one-time fixes.

AtkinsRéalis’ focus on advancing industrial cybersecurity capabilities and protecting critical infrastructure strongly resonates with my professional interests and experience. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills to your Calgary team and support the secure operation of essential transportation systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support AtkinsRéalis’ mission.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
