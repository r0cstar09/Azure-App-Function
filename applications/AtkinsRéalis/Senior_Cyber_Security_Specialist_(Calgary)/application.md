Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Specialist role at AtkinsRéalis. With over eight years of experience spanning SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in providing security oversight for environments where availability, safety, and risk management are critical.  

In my current and prior roles, I have supported public sector and enterprise organizations by monitoring security posture, responding to incidents, and translating threat and risk information into clear, actionable guidance for both technical teams and leadership. My experience working with municipal services and global client environments has reinforced the importance of disciplined security operations, clear communication, and alignment with organizational and regulatory requirements—principles that are essential in protecting critical transportation and infrastructure systems.  

I bring a practical, operations‑focused security mindset, complemented by strong analytical and reporting skills. Whether investigating incidents, tracking vulnerabilities, or producing intelligence to guide defensive priorities, I focus on supporting informed decision‑making and continuous improvement of security capabilities. AtkinsRéalis’ commitment to advancing industrial cybersecurity and supporting critical infrastructure aligns closely with my professional background and interests.  

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to your team and support the security and resilience of critical transportation systems in Calgary. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,
