## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security Operations Centre role at BDO. With over eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a balanced background of hands-on technical capability and advisory-focused security operations experience that aligns well with this opportunity.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC analyst roles into incident response and intelligence-focused positions supporting diverse environments. I have worked within enterprise and public-sector settings, providing operational support, structured incident handling, and intelligence-driven insights to improve detection, response, and resilience. This progression has allowed me to understand both the day-to-day realities of SOC operations and the broader strategic objectives organizations seek to achieve from their security programs.  

In consulting and response-focused roles, I have regularly translated security findings into clear, actionable guidance for both technical teams and leadership. I am particularly motivated by roles that combine operational excellence with client-facing advisory responsibilities, helping organizations understand risk, strengthen controls, and mature their security operations.  

BDO’s people-first culture and focus on trusted client relationships strongly resonate with my own professional values. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to BDO Digital’s Cyber Security Operations Centre and support clients in achieving stronger, more effective security outcomes.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support BDO’s continued success.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
