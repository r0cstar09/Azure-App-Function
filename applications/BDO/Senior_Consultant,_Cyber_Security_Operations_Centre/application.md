Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security Operations Centre role at BDO. With over eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in delivering high-quality security outcomes within both enterprise and consulting environments.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC analyst roles into positions supporting complex investigations and advisory engagements. This progression has allowed me to understand security operations from the analyst level through to senior stakeholder communication, an alignment that is essential for a consulting-focused SOC role. I have worked closely with security teams to enhance detection, response, and intelligence capabilities while ensuring activities remain aligned with organizational and client risk.  

In my most recent roles, I have contributed to threat intelligence and incident response efforts designed to directly support operational decision-making. I am experienced in producing clear, actionable reporting for both technical teams and leadership, and I value collaboration as a key component of effective security operations.  

BDO’s people-first culture and focus on trusted client relationships strongly resonate with my professional values. I am motivated by opportunities that allow me to support clients, mentor peers, and contribute to the ongoing maturity of security operations. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience and commitment to service excellence to BDO’s Cyber Security Operations Centre.
