## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager, Cyber Security Risk Management role at Irving Oil. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practitioner’s understanding of cyber risk and how it translates into organizational impact.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with technical teams and leadership by translating complex security events, threat activity, and vulnerabilities into clear, actionable insights. Whether supporting municipal infrastructure, global enterprises, or consulting clients, my focus has consistently been on understanding risk, prioritizing response, and improving resilience through structured operations and informed decision-making.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I produce executive-facing intelligence that connects adversary behavior to real-world organizational risk. Previously, my experience in incident response and SOC operations strengthened my ability to assess security events not only from a technical standpoint, but also in terms of business impact, recovery considerations, and governance alignment.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at Irving Oil because of its emphasis on cybersecurity risk management, cross-functional collaboration, and leadership engagement. I look forward to contributing my analytical background, communication skills, and operational experience to help drive risk-informed cybersecurity strategy across the organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support Irving Oil’s cybersecurity risk management objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
