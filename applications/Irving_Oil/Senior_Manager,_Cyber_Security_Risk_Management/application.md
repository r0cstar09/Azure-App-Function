## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager, Cyber Security Risk Management role at Irving Oil. With over eight years of experience across cybersecurity operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in assessing cyber risk, supporting governance, and translating technical security issues into meaningful insights for leadership.

Throughout my career, I have worked in both enterprise and public sector environments where cybersecurity decisions directly supported operational continuity and organizational risk objectives. My experience investigating security incidents, managing vulnerability remediation activities, and producing executive-level intelligence has consistently required balancing technical detail with business impact. This has prepared me well to act as a strategic bridge between technical teams and senior leadership.

In my current Threat Intelligence role, I focus on understanding adversary behavior, identifying emerging risks, and delivering assessments that inform proactive defense and strategic decision-making. Previously, my work in security operations and incident response strengthened my appreciation for disaster recovery preparedness, governance alignment, and the importance of clear communication during high-impact events.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at Irving Oil due to its emphasis on risk-informed decision-making and cross-functional leadership. I am eager to contribute my experience in cybersecurity risk analysis, governance support, and stakeholder communication to help strengthen and mature your cyber risk management programs.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background can support Irving Oil’s cybersecurity and risk management objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
