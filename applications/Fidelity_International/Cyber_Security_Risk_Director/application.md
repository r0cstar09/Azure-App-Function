## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Risk Director role at Fidelity International. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, risk-focused perspective that aligns closely with protecting complex organizations and supporting informed business decisions.

Throughout my career, I have worked at the intersection of technical security and organizational risk. From leading incident investigations to delivering executive-level threat intelligence, my focus has consistently been on understanding how cyber threats translate into operational, financial, and reputational risk. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I support strategic defense planning by assessing adversary behavior and communicating risk in a way that enables leadership to prioritize effectively.

Previously, my experience within municipal government and global security vendors strengthened my understanding of governance, compliance, and control effectiveness. I have supported environments where regulatory requirements, service availability, and public trust were critical, reinforcing the importance of aligning cybersecurity activities with broader enterprise risk management goals.

Fidelity’s commitment to protecting investor trust and embracing innovation strongly resonates with me. I am particularly interested in contributing my background in risk assessment, executive reporting, and security operations to help guide cybersecurity strategy and decision-making at the leadership level.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach to cybersecurity risk can support Fidelity International’s objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
