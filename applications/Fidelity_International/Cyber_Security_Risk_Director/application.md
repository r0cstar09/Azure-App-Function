## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Risk Director role at Fidelity International. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have built a strong foundation in understanding how cyber threats translate into business risk and how security organizations can respond effectively.

Throughout my career, I have supported both public and private sector environments, progressing from hands-on SOC operations into roles focused on intelligence, risk awareness, and executive communication. My current work as a Threat Intelligence Analyst centers on assessing emerging threats, evaluating their potential impact, and delivering clear, actionable insight to both technical teams and leadership. This experience has strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between technical risk and strategic decision-making.

Fidelity’s commitment to innovation and long-term client trust strongly resonates with me. I am particularly drawn to this role’s focus on risk leadership, collaboration, and aligning security programs with organizational objectives. My background in incident analysis, vulnerability management, and post-incident review has given me a practical understanding of how effective governance and risk oversight can meaningfully reduce exposure.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my experience to Fidelity’s cyber security leadership team and to help guide risk-informed decisions that protect both the organization and its clients. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
