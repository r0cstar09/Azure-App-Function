## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Consultant role at Bell. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in both hands-on security delivery and advisory-focused cybersecurity work.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from front-line SOC operations into senior analytical and response roles, supporting complex environments and stakeholders with varying risk tolerances. My experience spans enterprise security operations, consulting-driven incident response, and intelligence-led defense, allowing me to understand cybersecurity challenges from both operational and strategic perspectives. I am particularly experienced in translating technical security findings into clear, actionable guidance that supports business and leadership decision-making.

At One Arrow Consulting, I currently support organizations by delivering threat intelligence aligned to real-world risks and operational priorities. Previously, at Cisco Security, I worked directly with clients during high-impact incidents, providing structured response guidance and contributing to long-term security improvements. These experiences have strengthened my ability to operate as a trusted advisor in high-pressure environments—an essential capability for a senior consulting role.

Bell’s focus on advancing secure connectivity and delivering trusted digital services strongly aligns with my professional values. I am motivated by roles where I can help organizations strengthen their security posture while enabling business objectives, and I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Bell’s cybersecurity initiatives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and perspective can add value to TeamBell.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
