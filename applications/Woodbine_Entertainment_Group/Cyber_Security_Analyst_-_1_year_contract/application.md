## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst contract position at Woodbine Entertainment Group. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence functions, I bring a hands-on and pragmatic approach well suited to an operational environment supporting critical business systems and public-facing services.

Throughout my career, I have worked in SOC and security analyst roles where monitoring, triage, and rapid response were core responsibilities. Most recently, with the City of St. John’s, I supported endpoint and network security monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response activities within a municipal environment, balancing operational continuity with risk reduction. Earlier roles at Symantec and Cisco further strengthened my ability to analyze alerts, escalate incidents appropriately, and support remediation efforts across complex environments.

I am particularly drawn to Woodbine Entertainment Group’s focus on reliability, safety, and high-quality experiences. I value working closely with IT and operational teams to ensure security controls enable, rather than obstruct, business objectives. I am comfortable communicating both technical details and risk-based summaries to support informed decision-making.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and support Woodbine’s security operations during this contract engagement. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
