## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst contract position at Woodbine Entertainment Group. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence functions, I bring a strong operational security background well aligned with the requirements of this role.

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments requiring consistent monitoring, accurate incident triage, and clear communication with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders. My experience spans municipal government, enterprise security operations, consulting, and managed response environments, supporting organizations with varied risk profiles and operational needs.

In my most recent roles, I have supported day‑to‑day security monitoring, vulnerability management activities, and incident response workflows, ensuring security issues are properly investigated, documented, and remediated. I am comfortable working within established security processes while continuously looking for opportunities to improve detection, documentation, and collaboration across teams.

Woodbine Entertainment Group’s long‑standing reputation and forward‑looking vision strongly resonate with me. I am particularly interested in contributing to an organization that values both operational excellence and reliability in delivering high‑quality experiences to its customers.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and approach to cybersecurity can support Woodbine’s security objectives during this contract engagement. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
