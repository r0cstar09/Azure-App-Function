## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security Operations Centre role at BDO Canada. With over eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational mindset and a people-focused approach that aligns well with BDO’s client-centric culture.

Throughout my career, I have supported security operations in enterprise, consulting, and public-sector environments. I progressed from Tier 1 SOC monitoring to more senior roles involving incident response leadership and threat intelligence delivery. This path has given me a solid understanding of how security operations function end to end—from alert triage and escalation to investigation, remediation, and executive reporting.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I work closely with SOC and incident response teams to ensure intelligence outputs directly support detection and response priorities. Previously, as an Incident Responder and SOC Analyst, I routinely collaborated with stakeholders to communicate risk, guide response actions, and improve operational processes. I am comfortable translating complex technical findings into practical guidance for both technical teams and non-technical leadership.

BDO’s emphasis on trusted client relationships and professional growth strongly resonates with me. I am particularly interested in contributing my operational experience, analytical perspective, and communication skills to help clients strengthen and mature their security operations.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and approach could support BDO Digital’s Cyber Security Operations Centre practice.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
