## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security Operations Centre position with BDO Canada. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a well-rounded background that aligns strongly with the needs of a client-focused SOC consulting environment.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from hands-on SOC analyst roles into incident response and, most recently, threat intelligence. This progression has given me a deep understanding of how effective security operations function in practice—from alert triage and escalation through to investigation, response, and post-incident improvement. I have worked in both enterprise and consulting-oriented settings, supporting internal stakeholders as well as external clients who rely on clear guidance during high-pressure security events.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on producing actionable insights that directly support SOC and incident response teams. I regularly translate complex threat activity into concise intelligence that can be consumed by technical practitioners and leadership alike. Previously, as an Incident Responder and SOC Analyst, I developed strong operational instincts for prioritization, communication, and maintaining service quality in fast-moving security environments.

BDO’s people-first culture and emphasis on trusted client relationships are particularly appealing to me. I value environments where technical excellence and professional growth are balanced with collaboration and mentorship. I would welcome the opportunity to apply my operational experience and analytical mindset to support BDO’s clients while continuing to grow as a senior SOC consultant.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to BDO Digital’s Cyber Security Operations Centre.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
