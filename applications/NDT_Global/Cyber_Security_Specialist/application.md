Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at NDT Global. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and risk-focused approach to protecting complex environments and supporting mission-critical operations.

Throughout my career, I have worked in both enterprise and public-sector settings, supporting continuous security monitoring, investigating security incidents, and translating threat activity into actionable guidance. My progression from SOC analyst to incident responder and threat intelligence analyst reflects a deep understanding of how security monitoring, response, and analysis intersect to protect organizational assets. This perspective aligns well with NDT Global’s focus on safeguarding critical infrastructure through reliable and resilient operations.

In my current and previous roles, I have collaborated closely with technical teams to strengthen detection capabilities, improve response readiness, and communicate risk clearly to stakeholders. I am particularly drawn to NDT Global’s work in the energy sector, where strong cybersecurity practices are essential to ensuring operational continuity, safety, and trust.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and analytical mindset to NDT Global’s security team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background can support your organization’s mission.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
