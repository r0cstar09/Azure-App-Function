## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at BNP Paribas in Montréal. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong defensive security background well suited to a complex, regulated financial environment.

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations ranging from global technology providers to public-sector institutions, helping detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in high-risk environments. I have progressed from frontline SOC analysis into roles focused on incident response and intelligence-driven security, allowing me to understand both day-to-day operational pressures and longer-term security strategy. This background enables me to approach security challenges with a balanced perspective that considers technical risk, business impact, and regulatory expectations.

In my current threat intelligence role, I focus on understanding adversary behavior and translating it into actionable insights for security teams. Previously, as an incident responder and SOC analyst, I worked directly with alerts, investigations, and remediation efforts, developing a practical understanding of how controls, detections, and procedures perform under real-world conditions. This experience aligns well with a Cyber Security Specialist role that supports continuous improvement of an organization’s security posture.

BNP Paribas’ commitment to resilience, sustainability, and excellence within the financial sector strongly resonates with me. I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to contribute my skills within a global banking environment where security, trust, and risk management are critical to success.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience and approach to cybersecurity can support BNP Paribas’ security objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
