## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at BNP Paribas. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, risk-focused approach well suited to a large, regulated financial environment.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC operations to advanced investigative and intelligence roles. This progression has given me a strong understanding of how security controls, detection capabilities, and response processes must work together to protect complex organizations. In both public-sector and consulting environments, I have supported incident investigations, vulnerability management, and security reporting aligned with organizational risk and governance expectations.  

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on translating adversary behavior into actionable intelligence that supports defensive teams and leadership decision-making. This analytical mindset, combined with hands-on operational experience, allows me to contribute effectively to prevention, detection, and response initiatives.  

BNP Paribas’ commitment to security, resilience, and sustainability strongly aligns with my professional values. I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to contribute to a global financial institution where security rigor and collaboration are critical to business trust. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support your cybersecurity objectives in Montreal.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
