## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position at Price Industries. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat analysis, I bring a practical and disciplined approach to protecting organizational environments and supporting reliable business operations.

Throughout my career, I have worked in roles that required consistent monitoring, investigation, and coordination with technical and non-technical stakeholders. From my early experience in a SOC environment to more recent roles supporting security analysis and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in identifying potential risks, responding to security incidents, and helping organizations improve their defensive posture.

I am particularly drawn to Price Industries because of its emphasis on reliability, integrity, and long-term quality. My experience supporting public and private sector environments has reinforced the importance of security programs that enable the business rather than disrupt it. I take a pragmatic approach to cybersecurity—focusing on clarity, prioritization, and measurable risk reduction.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to Price Industries’ security initiatives and to continue growing as part of a collaborative and values-driven organization. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
