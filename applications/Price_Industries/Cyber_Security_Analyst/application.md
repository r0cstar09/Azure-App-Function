## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position at Price Industries. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat analysis, I bring a strong operational mindset and a practical approach to protecting business-critical systems.

Throughout my career, I have worked in enterprise and public-sector environments where stability, reliability, and risk management were essential. My experience monitoring security events, investigating incidents, and supporting remediation efforts aligns well with the needs of a manufacturing organization that depends on dependable systems and uninterrupted operations. I am especially comfortable working alongside IT and operations teams to ensure that security controls support, rather than hinder, business objectives.

Currently working in threat intelligence and previously supporting hands‑on security operations, I have developed strong skills in analyzing security issues, documenting findings, and communicating risks clearly to both technical teams and management. I value structured processes, continuous improvement, and accountability—principles that closely reflect Price Industries’ long-standing commitment to quality and integrity.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and work ethic to Price Industries’ security team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background can support your organization.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
