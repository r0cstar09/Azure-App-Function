## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer II – Database role at TD. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence in enterprise environments, I bring a strong operational foundation and a risk-focused mindset well aligned with TD’s technology and security objectives.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with infrastructure, engineering, and operations teams to monitor environments, respond to security incidents, and translate threat intelligence into actionable defensive improvements. My experience spans large organizations, regulated environments, and distributed systems, requiring consistent alignment between security controls, operational needs, and risk management priorities.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding how real-world adversaries operate and ensuring that defensive teams have the context needed to protect critical systems. Previously, as a Security Analyst and Incident Responder, I supported vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident handling efforts that helped strengthen organizational resilience and maturity.

I am particularly drawn to this role at TD due to its emphasis on integrating security into core technology platforms and supporting long-term risk reduction. I am confident my background in security operations, investigation, and cross-team collaboration would allow me to contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow as a security engineer within TD.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support TD’s cybersecurity mission.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
