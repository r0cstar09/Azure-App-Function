## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer II – Database role at TD. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in protecting enterprise technology environments through effective monitoring, investigation, and risk-aligned security practices.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in highly regulated and large-scale environments, supporting security operations that emphasize resilience, accountability, and continuous improvement. My experience spans frontline detection and response, vulnerability management, and intelligence-led security analysis. This progression has allowed me to understand how security controls operate in practice and how they align to broader organizational risk and compliance requirements.  

At City of St. John’s and Cisco Security, I supported incident response and remediation efforts that required close collaboration with technical and business stakeholders. I am comfortable working within structured governance models and contributing to security programs where reliability, documentation, and process discipline are critical. My current role in threat intelligence further strengthens my ability to anticipate emerging risks and translate them into actionable defensive considerations.  

TD’s emphasis on secure, well-governed technology platforms strongly aligns with my background and professional interests. I am particularly motivated by opportunities that combine engineering-minded security practices with operational awareness and risk management. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to TD’s cybersecurity team and support the continued protection of critical systems.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support this role.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
