## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst II role with Hostway. With over eight years of hands-on experience across Security Operations, Incident Response, and Threat Intelligence, I bring a strong operational mindset well aligned to a managed and hybrid security environment.  

My background includes SOC monitoring, alert triage, vulnerability management, and incident investigation across enterprise and distributed environments. I have supported both internal organizations and external clients, working closely with security teams to investigate threats, contain incidents, and improve defensive posture. Through roles in SOC, IR, and intelligence analysis, I developed the ability to assess security events quickly, communicate findings clearly, and prioritize actions based on operational risk.  

I am particularly interested in this role due to its focus on continuous security monitoring, incident response, and collaboration within a managed security model. I am comfortable working in structured operational environments and supporting extended-hour coverage, and I value clear processes, documentation, and teamwork.  

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and continue growing within Hostway’s security operations team. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
