## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager, Cyber Security position at Innocap Investment Management. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong blend of hands‑on technical depth and leadership‑oriented security thinking that aligns well with Innocap’s mission and operating environment.  

Throughout my career, I have supported and guided security teams responsible for protecting enterprise environments, responding to incidents, and translating cyber threats into actionable risk insights. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on enabling SOC and response teams through clear, relevant intelligence and executive‑level reporting—ensuring that security priorities align with real‑world adversary activity and organizational risk.  

Previously, my experience within municipal government and global security providers has given me exposure to regulated environments, policy enforcement, and cross‑functional collaboration with IT and leadership stakeholders. These roles strengthened my ability to balance operational security needs with governance, compliance, and business continuity considerations—key elements in a financial services organization such as Innocap.  

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity due to Innocap’s global footprint and commitment to innovation within the investment management space. I am confident that my background in security operations leadership, incident management, and intelligence‑driven defense would allow me to contribute effectively to both the strategic and operational goals of your cybersecurity program.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach to cybersecurity management could support Innocap’s continued growth and security maturity.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
