## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager, Cyber Security position at Innocap. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and risk-focused approach to managing and strengthening cybersecurity programs in complex environments.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from hands-on SOC operations into roles focused on incident coordination, investigations, and intelligence-driven decision-making. This progression has given me a strong understanding of how effective cyber security programs operate end-to-end — from detection and response through to executive reporting and strategic risk alignment. I am particularly comfortable translating technical security observations into clear, actionable insights that support leadership and business objectives.  

In my most recent role, I focus on delivering intelligence that informs defensive priorities and long-term security posture, working closely with operational teams and decision-makers. Previously, I supported regulated public-sector environments and global enterprise clients, contributing to incident handling, vulnerability management, and continuous improvement of security processes. These experiences align well with the diligence, precision, and accountability required in an investment management context.  

I am drawn to Innocap’s global footprint and its emphasis on delivering trusted services to institutional clients. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to managing and maturing Innocap’s cyber security capabilities while supporting its mission to provide exceptional client outcomes.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background could support Innocap’s security objectives.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
