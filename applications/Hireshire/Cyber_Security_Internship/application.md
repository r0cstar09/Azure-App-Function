Dear Hiring Team at Hireshire,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Internship role at Hireshire. With a strong foundation in cybersecurity operations and several years of hands-on exposure to security monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence, I am eager to continue learning and contributing within a modern, growth-focused organization.

Throughout my career, I have worked in structured security environments supporting SOC operations, responding to common cyber threats, and assisting with vulnerability management and security documentation. These experiences have given me a practical understanding of how security teams protect systems and data, as well as the importance of clear communication, attention to detail, and continuous improvement.

What excites me about Hireshire is the opportunity to apply my existing skills in a collaborative internship setting while expanding my knowledge across cybersecurity, cloud, and emerging technologies. I value learning from experienced professionals and contributing wherever needed, whether that involves supporting monitoring activities, assisting with incident response tasks, or helping maintain strong security practices.
