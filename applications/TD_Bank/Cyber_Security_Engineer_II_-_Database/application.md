## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer II – Database role at TD Bank. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in protecting enterprise environments and supporting risk-based security outcomes.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with monitoring, investigation, and remediation processes that support the security of critical systems and data. My background includes responding to complex security incidents, analyzing adversary behavior, and providing actionable guidance to technical teams. While my experience spans multiple security domains, a consistent focus has been ensuring that detection, response, and risk controls align with organizational priorities.

In roles supporting both public sector and enterprise clients, I have collaborated with diverse stakeholders to translate security findings into clear, practical recommendations. I am particularly interested in this opportunity at TD due to the emphasis on protecting sensitive data assets and operating within a mature, regulated environment.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my operational security experience and analytical mindset to TD’s cybersecurity team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
