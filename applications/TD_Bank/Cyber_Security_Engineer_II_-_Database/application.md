## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer II – Database role at TD Bank. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in protecting critical systems, supporting investigations, and aligning security activities with organizational risk and governance expectations.

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments where the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of enterprise data are paramount. From my early experience in a global SOC to my more recent roles in incident response and threat intelligence, I have consistently supported teams responsible for monitoring, investigating, and reducing security risk across complex infrastructures. This experience has strengthened my ability to assess threats, support remediation efforts, and contribute to security programs that protect sensitive business information.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on translating adversary behavior into actionable insights that improve detection and defensive decision‑making. Previously, as a Security Analyst and Incident Responder, I supported vulnerability management, incident handling, and recovery efforts while adhering to organizational policies and compliance requirements. These experiences align closely with the expectations of a security engineering role focused on safeguarding critical data platforms and supporting resilient operations.

I am particularly drawn to TD Bank’s emphasis on mature security practices, collaboration, and ongoing professional growth. I am confident that my background in operational security, investigative analysis, and clear communication would enable me to contribute effectively to your Technology Solutions team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience aligns with TD’s security objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
