## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer role at D3 Security. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational foundation aligned with the mission of building scalable, intelligent SecOps solutions.  

Throughout my career, I have worked across SOC environments, responding to real-world security incidents and supporting detection and response teams with actionable intelligence. My progression from SOC Tier 1 to Tier 2 analyst, incident responder, and most recently threat intelligence analyst, has provided me with a practical understanding of how security alerts, investigations, and response workflows intersect. This perspective aligns closely with D3’s focus on automating and enhancing Tier 1–3 analyst work through Morpheus.  

In my recent roles, I have focused on helping security teams operate more effectively by improving visibility, contextualizing alerts, and mapping threats to frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK. I regularly translate technical findings into outputs that support both operational teams and leadership, ensuring security efforts are aligned with organizational risk and priorities.  

I am particularly drawn to D3 Security’s emphasis on autonomous security operations and modern SecOps transformation. My background in SOC operations and incident response would allow me to contribute meaningfully to engineering security workflows that are both practical and scalable. I am excited by the opportunity to work with a team focused on advancing how security operations function at scale.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support D3 Security’s mission and engineering goals.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
