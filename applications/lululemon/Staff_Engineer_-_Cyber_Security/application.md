Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Staff Engineer – Cyber Security role at lululemon. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a depth of technical security expertise paired with a strong ability to align security outcomes to business priorities.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC operations into roles focused on leading investigations, advising stakeholders, and producing intelligence that informs both operational and strategic decisions. My background has allowed me to work across complex environments, supporting detection and response improvements while ensuring security efforts remain practical, scalable, and aligned with organizational risk.

In recent roles, I have focused on analyzing adversary behavior, strengthening response processes, and delivering clear guidance to security teams and leadership. I am particularly drawn to lululemon’s emphasis on innovation and community, and I see strong alignment between that culture and my approach to security—protecting people and systems while enabling growth and transformation.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to lululemon’s security engineering efforts and to help evolve resilient, forward-looking cyber defense capabilities. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
