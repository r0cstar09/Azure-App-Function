## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Team,  

I am excited to apply for the Staff Engineer – Cyber Security opportunity at lululemon. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practitioner’s perspective on building and sustaining effective security programs within complex enterprise environments.  

Throughout my career, I have worked across consulting, public sector, and global enterprise contexts, progressing from hands-on SOC analysis to leading investigations and delivering intelligence that informs both operational and strategic decisions. These roles have given me a strong appreciation for how detection, response, and risk management must work together to support business objectives rather than operate in isolation.  

In my current and recent roles, I have focused on translating threat and incident data into actionable guidance for security teams and leadership. I routinely align security findings with organizational risk, help prioritize defensive investments, and support continuous improvement of monitoring and response capabilities. This mindset aligns closely with a Staff Engineer role, where influence, technical depth, and long-term security vision are essential.  

I am particularly drawn to lululemon’s emphasis on innovation and people-centered experiences. I am motivated by environments where security engineering is embedded into how the organization enables growth, resilience, and trust at scale. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to strengthening lululemon’s cyber security posture.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background could support your team.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
