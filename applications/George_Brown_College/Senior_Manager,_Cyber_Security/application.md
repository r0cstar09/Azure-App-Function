## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager, Cyber Security position at George Brown College. With over eight years of progressive experience across cybersecurity operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a balanced background in both hands-on security practice and strategic risk-oriented leadership.

Throughout my career, I have supported and guided complex security operations in enterprise and public-sector environments. My experience includes leading incident escalations, shaping intelligence-driven defensive priorities, and translating technical cyber risk into clear, actionable insight for non-technical stakeholders. In my current and recent roles, I have worked closely with teams responsible for protecting critical services, supporting governance objectives, and ensuring security practices align with organizational policy and accountability expectations.

I am particularly drawn to this role at George Brown College due to its focus on institutional resilience, stakeholder trust, and service continuity within a diverse educational environment. My background working with municipal government and global organizations has equipped me to operate effectively within regulated, mission-driven institutions where security must support—not impede—core objectives.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my experience in security operations leadership, risk awareness, and collaborative problem-solving to George Brown College’s Information Technology division. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your cybersecurity leadership needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
