## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Committee,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager, Cyber Security position at George Brown College. With over eight years of progressive experience in cybersecurity operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a broad perspective on protecting complex organizations while aligning security efforts with institutional priorities.  

Throughout my career, I have supported enterprise and public‑sector environments, contributing to the detection, assessment, and response to cybersecurity risks. My experience spans operational security monitoring, incident coordination, vulnerability management, and intelligence‑driven risk analysis. This background has strengthened my ability to evaluate threats in context, prioritize mitigations, and communicate security issues clearly to diverse stakeholders.  

In my recent roles, I have focused on producing actionable security insights that support decision‑making at both technical and leadership levels. I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to help an academic institution balance strong security controls with the needs of students, faculty, and staff. I value collaboration, clear governance, and building security programs that enable organizational objectives rather than hinder them.  

George Brown College’s commitment to education, community, and responsible stewardship aligns strongly with my professional values. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to advancing the college’s cybersecurity posture and supporting a resilient, secure learning environment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can support George Brown College’s cybersecurity goals.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
