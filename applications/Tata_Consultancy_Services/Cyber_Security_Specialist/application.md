## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at Tata Consultancy Services in Toronto. With more than eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a well-rounded background supporting enterprise environments and mission-critical systems.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed through SOC, incident response, and intelligence-focused roles, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how security monitoring, investigation, and risk management intersect. I have worked in both private-sector and public-sector contexts, contributing to daily security operations, responding to incidents, and producing clear, actionable security assessments for technical and non-technical stakeholders.  

My experience aligns well with a Cyber Security Specialist role that requires hands-on operational awareness, analytical thinking, and strong communication skills. I am particularly drawn to TCS’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and delivering security services at scale within complex client environments.  

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and continue growing as part of TCS’s cybersecurity practice. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
