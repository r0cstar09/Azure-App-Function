## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at Tata Consultancy Services in Toronto. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and risk-focused approach to protecting enterprise environments.

Throughout my career, I have supported diverse organizations by monitoring security events, responding to incidents, and producing intelligence that strengthens defensive operations. My background includes progressing through SOC roles, responding to active security incidents, and delivering clear security reporting that supports both technical teams and leadership decision-making. This experience has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of how cybersecurity functions within complex, service-driven organizations.

TCS’s focus on large-scale IT services and its commitment to inclusion and diversity strongly resonate with me. I am particularly motivated by environments where collaboration, process maturity, and continuous improvement are valued, and where cybersecurity directly supports business outcomes for a broad client base.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to TCS and to continue developing as part of your cybersecurity team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
