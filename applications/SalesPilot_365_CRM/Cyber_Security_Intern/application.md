Dear Hiring Team at SalesPilot 365,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Intern position with SalesPilot 365. Your focus on building modern, secure platforms at the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud, and emerging technologies closely aligns with my background and long-term career interests.

Throughout my career, I have supported security operations in a variety of environments, including SOC monitoring, incident response support, and threat analysis. While I have held full-time roles, I am specifically drawn to this internship opportunity because it emphasizes hands-on learning, collaboration with IT and security teams, and exposure to real-world system protection challenges within a growing organization.

My experience has allowed me to build a strong foundation in security fundamentals such as log review, incident triage, vulnerability management processes, and clear technical documentation. I am comfortable following established procedures, learning new environments quickly, and contributing wherever support is needed. I bring a disciplined, detail-oriented mindset and a genuine interest in continuing to grow alongside experienced professionals.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to SalesPilot 365 while further developing my skills in a modern, forward-thinking security team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support your internship cohort.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
