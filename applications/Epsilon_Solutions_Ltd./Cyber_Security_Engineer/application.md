## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer position at Epsilon Solutions Ltd. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong advisory-focused cybersecurity background well-suited to supporting complex, safety-critical environments such as railway systems.

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations by assessing cyber threats, identifying risks, and providing clear, actionable security guidance aligned with recognized frameworks. My progression from SOC operations into incident response and threat intelligence has allowed me to develop a broad understanding of how security risks emerge throughout the lifecycle of systems—from design considerations through operational monitoring and incident handling.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on translating adversary behavior and emerging threats into practical defensive recommendations that support both technical teams and executive decision-makers. Previously, in public-sector and enterprise environments, I contributed to vulnerability management, policy enforcement, incident assessment, and post-incident improvement efforts—experience directly relevant to providing assurance and advisory services on cybersecurity requirements and risk mitigation.

I am particularly interested in this role due to its emphasis on security framework development, standards alignment, and early-stage security integration. I am confident my background in risk-focused analysis, reporting, and advisory support would enable me to add value to Epsilon Solutions’ work in securing critical infrastructure projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support your cybersecurity engineering objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
