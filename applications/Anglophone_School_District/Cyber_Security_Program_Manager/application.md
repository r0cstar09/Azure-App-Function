## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Program Manager position with the Anglophone School District. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence—much of it supporting public sector and highly regulated environments—I bring a strong foundation in aligning cybersecurity activities with organizational risk and governance objectives.

Throughout my career, I have worked within structured security programs that required balancing operational realities with policy, compliance, and stakeholder expectations. In municipal and enterprise environments, I supported vulnerability management initiatives, coordinated incident response activities, and produced clear, decision-oriented reporting for both technical teams and leadership. These experiences have reinforced the importance of consistent governance, cross-team communication, and practical risk management—key elements of an effective cybersecurity program.

In my current role in threat intelligence, I contribute to higher-level security decision-making by translating complex threat information into actionable insights. This work has strengthened my ability to communicate clearly with diverse audiences and to ensure security efforts remain aligned with organizational priorities rather than purely technical outcomes.

I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to support the Anglophone School District in protecting educational systems and public trust. I believe my background in public sector environments, combined with hands-on operational experience and a strong understanding of security frameworks, positions me well to help oversee, coordinate, and mature cybersecurity programs in support of district-wide objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and perspective can contribute to the success of your cybersecurity program.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
