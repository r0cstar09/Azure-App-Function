## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Program Manager position with the Anglophone School District. With over eight years of experience supporting cybersecurity operations across public sector and enterprise environments, I bring a strong foundation in security governance, incident response, and risk-informed decision-making that aligns well with the objectives of this role.

Throughout my career, I have supported security programs by coordinating operational activities, contributing to policy-aligned security practices, and producing clear documentation to support leadership decision-making. My experience working within municipal and regulated environments has strengthened my understanding of accountability, compliance, and the importance of aligning cybersecurity initiatives with organizational objectives.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I support security teams by translating complex threat information into actionable insights. Previously, with the City of St. John’s, I contributed directly to public-sector cybersecurity operations, supporting vulnerability management, monitoring, incident response, and internal coordination. These experiences have reinforced the importance of structured programs, clear communication, and cross-functional collaboration in maintaining effective cyber security posture.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of its focus on program-level security management in support of education and government services. I am motivated by roles where cybersecurity enables organizational mission and service delivery, and I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to the Anglophone School District’s cybersecurity objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience and approach can support your cybersecurity program.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
