## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong combination of technical depth and advisory capability well suited to a large, complex organization supporting millions of Canadians.

Throughout my career, I have worked in high-visibility environments where security decisions directly impacted organizational resilience and service availability. My experience supporting incident response at Cisco Security and municipal operations at the City of St. John’s required clear, risk-informed guidance during both steady-state operations and active security events. More recently, as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I have focused on translating adversary activity into actionable insights that help leadership and security teams prioritize defenses and investments.

What draws me to Rogers is the scale and societal importance of the technology you operate. Advising on cybersecurity within a national communications provider requires strong collaboration, pragmatic risk assessment, and the ability to communicate clearly with both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders—capabilities I have consistently applied across my roles. I am particularly motivated by opportunities where cybersecurity directly enables reliability, trust, and innovation.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience to Rogers’ Technology team and help strengthen the security posture that supports Canadians coast to coast. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
