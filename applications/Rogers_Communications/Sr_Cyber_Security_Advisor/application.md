## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Advisor position at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a well-rounded perspective that bridges technical execution and strategic security advisory.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC analysis to roles focused on incident response and intelligence-driven decision support. This progression has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of how security controls, processes, and intelligence directly support organizational risk management and business continuity. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I provide actionable insights that help organizations anticipate threats, prioritize defenses, and communicate risk clearly to both technical teams and leadership.

I am particularly drawn to Rogers’ scale and national impact. Supporting critical connectivity for millions of Canadians requires a security program that is both resilient and forward-looking. My background in analyzing threat trends, advising on incident response, and aligning security activities with policy and compliance objectives would allow me to contribute meaningfully to that mission.

I am comfortable working with diverse stakeholders, translating complex security issues into practical recommendations, and supporting high-visibility initiatives where risk, reliability, and trust are paramount. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience and advisory mindset to the Rogers Technology team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with this role.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
