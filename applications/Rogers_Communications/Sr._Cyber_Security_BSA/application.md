## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security BSA role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong ability to translate cybersecurity risks and technical findings into meaningful insights that support business and technology leaders.  

Throughout my career, I have worked within complex, high-visibility environments, supporting both public- and private-sector organizations. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on assessing real-world threats, mapping adversary behaviors to frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, and delivering intelligence that informs defensive priorities. Previously, my experience in incident response and SOC operations strengthened my ability to analyze security gaps, assess impact, and communicate findings clearly to diverse stakeholders.  

What draws me to Rogers is the scale and importance of its technology footprint and its role in connecting millions of Canadians. I am particularly interested in contributing as a cybersecurity-focused business analyst who can bridge security operations, risk considerations, and organizational objectives to support large, complex initiatives. My background enables me to ask the right questions, identify control and process gaps, and help ensure security is thoughtfully integrated into technology programs.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and analytical approach can support Rogers’ cybersecurity goals. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
