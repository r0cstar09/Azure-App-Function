## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security BSA role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence in large and complex environments, I have developed a strong ability to translate technical security findings into actionable insights that support business and technology objectives.  

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC teams, incident responders, and leadership to assess cyber risk, align security activities with organizational priorities, and improve decision-making. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I regularly analyze emerging threats and communicate their relevance to enterprise defenses, enabling informed planning and control adjustments. Previously, my roles in municipal government and global security services strengthened my understanding of governance, remediation coordination, and stakeholder communication.  

I am particularly drawn to Rogers’ large-scale, high-visibility technology environment and the opportunity to contribute to initiatives that impact millions of Canadians. My background in security analysis, risk communication, and cross-functional collaboration aligns well with a BSA-style role focused on bridging technical security concerns with business needs.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support Rogers Communications’ cybersecurity objectives.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
