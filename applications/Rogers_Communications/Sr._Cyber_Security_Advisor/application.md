## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in advising organizations on how to manage cyber risk while supporting reliable, large-scale technology environments.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in both public and private sector contexts, supporting complex infrastructures and diverse stakeholder needs. My experience enables me to bridge the gap between technical security operations and strategic decision-making, ensuring that security efforts are aligned with organizational priorities and business outcomes. I am particularly comfortable translating technical findings into clear guidance for leadership and cross-functional teams.  

Rogers’ focus on delivering highly available, secure services to millions of Canadians strongly resonates with my professional background. I bring a pragmatic, operations-informed perspective to cybersecurity advisory work, grounded in hands-on experience with detection, response, and threat analysis. I thrive in environments where security is embedded into large, high-visibility initiatives and where collaboration is essential to success.  

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and perspective to Rogers Communications and support the continued resilience of its technology platforms. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
