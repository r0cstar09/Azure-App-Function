## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong blend of technical depth and advisory capability well suited to supporting a large, complex organization serving millions of Canadians.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC operations into senior investigative and intelligence-focused roles. This progression has given me a practical understanding of how security controls operate in real-world environments, as well as how to translate operational security insights into risk-aware recommendations for leadership. My experience supporting public sector environments and global enterprises has reinforced the importance of aligning cybersecurity strategy with organizational priorities, resilience, and service reliability.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding emerging threats and communicating their potential impact in a way that enables informed decision-making. Previously, as an Incident Responder and Security Analyst, I supported high-visibility incidents, vulnerability management efforts, and security governance activities, providing me with a well-rounded perspective on enterprise cybersecurity challenges.

Rogers’ scale, complexity, and critical role in Canada’s connectivity strongly resonate with me. I am particularly interested in contributing as a trusted security advisor who can partner with technical teams and stakeholders to strengthen security posture while enabling innovation and growth.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience and approach can support Rogers Communications’ cybersecurity objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
