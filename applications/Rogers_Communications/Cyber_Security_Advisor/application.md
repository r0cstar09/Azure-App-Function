## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, advisory-focused approach to helping organizations manage cyber risk while supporting complex, high-visibility technology environments.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC teams, incident responders, and security leadership to assess threats, prioritize vulnerabilities, and translate technical findings into clear recommendations. My experience supporting municipal, enterprise, and consulting environments has strengthened my ability to balance security best practices with real-world operational constraints—an essential capability for advisory roles in large, distributed organizations like Rogers.

I am particularly drawn to Rogers’ commitment to large-scale technology initiatives that impact millions of Canadians. My background in incident response and intelligence analysis allows me to anticipate how threats evolve in complex networks and to advise on proactive measures that strengthen resilience and reduce business risk.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and collaborative mindset to the Rogers Technology team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
