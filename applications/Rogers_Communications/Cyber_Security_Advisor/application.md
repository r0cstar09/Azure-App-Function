## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Advisor role with Rogers Communications. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in advising organizations on how to manage cyber risk while maintaining resilient, large‑scale technology environments.

Throughout my career, I have worked in high‑visibility and operationally critical settings, including global security service providers and municipal infrastructure. These roles required not only technical security knowledge, but also the ability to communicate risk clearly, align security actions with business priorities, and support stakeholders during complex security events. My progression from SOC analyst roles into incident response and intelligence-focused positions reflects my ongoing focus on proactive, advisory-driven security outcomes.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I support defensive operations by assessing emerging threats and translating intelligence into concise, actionable guidance. Previously, as a Security Analyst for the City of St. John’s, I contributed to vulnerability management, incident response, and policy enforcement in a public-sector environment where service availability and public trust were paramount. Across all roles, I have consistently partnered with technical teams and leadership to strengthen security posture and decision-making.

Rogers’ scale, national impact, and focus on enabling connectivity across Canada strongly align with my professional interests. I am particularly motivated by opportunities to support large, complex technology environments where security advisory skills directly influence resilience and innovation. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and perspective to Rogers’ Technology team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with this role.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
