## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational foundation combined with the ability to translate technical security insights into meaningful, risk-informed guidance.

Throughout my career, I have supported complex and high-visibility environments, from enterprise SOC operations to public sector security programs and external client incident response. My progression from hands-on monitoring and investigation roles into intelligence-focused analysis has provided me with a broad perspective on how security controls, detection capabilities, and response processes come together to reduce organizational risk.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I contribute intelligence that supports defensive decision-making and operational prioritization. Previously, I supported vulnerability management, incident handling, and security monitoring in a municipal environment, and worked directly with enterprise clients at Cisco Security during active security incidents. These experiences have strengthened my ability to advise stakeholders, align security efforts with business needs, and communicate clearly at both technical and executive levels.

Rogers’ commitment to operating large-scale, mission-critical technology environments is particularly compelling to me. I am motivated by opportunities where security advice directly supports resilience, trust, and reliable service delivery for millions of users. I am confident my background in operational security, response coordination, and advisory support would allow me to contribute effectively to your Technology team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with the Cyber Security Advisor role at Rogers Communications.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
