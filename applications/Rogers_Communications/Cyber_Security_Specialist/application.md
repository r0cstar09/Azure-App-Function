Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational security background aligned with the needs of large, complex enterprise environments.

Throughout my career, I have supported security monitoring, incident response, and risk-focused analysis across both public-sector and global enterprise settings. My progression from SOC Analyst to Incident Responder and Threat Intelligence Analyst reflects a deepening ability to assess security threats, respond effectively to incidents, and communicate risk in a clear and actionable manner. I have consistently worked within high-visibility environments where operational reliability and security are critical.

Rogers’ commitment to supporting Canadians through robust and forward-looking technology strongly aligns with my experience operating in environments where availability, security, and trust are paramount. I am particularly motivated by roles that require collaboration across technical teams, disciplined security operations, and continuous improvement of defensive capabilities.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and dedication to Rogers Communications’ Cyber Security team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
