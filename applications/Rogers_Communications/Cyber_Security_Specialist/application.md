## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a well-rounded perspective on protecting complex, high-visibility environments. My background aligns closely with the need to support large-scale technology operations while maintaining a strong security posture.  

Throughout my career, I have supported SOC environments, participated in active incident response, and delivered intelligence that helps organizations understand and prioritize risk. Progressing from hands-on monitoring roles into investigation and intelligence-focused positions has allowed me to connect tactical security events with broader organizational impact—an approach well suited to a large, nationally critical organization like Rogers.  

I am particularly drawn to Rogers’ role in supporting millions of Canadians through resilient, forward-looking technology. My experience collaborating with technical teams and communicating clearly with stakeholders would allow me to contribute effectively to protecting those services.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach to cybersecurity can support Rogers Communications.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
