## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager Cyber Security Platform role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have built a strong foundation supporting, operating, and continuously improving enterprise security platforms in complex environments.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from hands-on SOC analysis to leading investigations and threat intelligence initiatives that directly impact how security platforms are tuned, governed, and aligned to organizational risk. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I work closely with SOC and incident response teams to translate adversary behavior into actionable detections, reporting, and strategic insight. Previously, my experience supporting municipal and global enterprise environments strengthened my ability to operate within structured governance frameworks while balancing operational demands.

What draws me to Rogers is the opportunity to contribute to a large-scale, high-visibility technology environment that directly impacts millions of Canadians. I am particularly interested in roles that sit at the intersection of security operations, platform capability, and continuous improvement—ensuring that tools, processes, and people are aligned to deliver measurable security outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my operational background, threat-focused mindset, and collaborative approach to the Cyber Security Platform team at Rogers. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
