## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager, Cyber Security Platform role at Rogers Communications. With over eight years of hands-on experience operating, supporting, and improving enterprise security platforms across SOC, Incident Response, and Threat Intelligence environments, I bring a strong technical foundation paired with a clear understanding of how security platforms support large-scale, business-critical operations.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with endpoint, network, and SIEM platforms to support continuous monitoring, detection, and response. My roles within municipal government, global security vendors, and consulting environments required me to understand not only how tools function, but how they integrate into broader technology ecosystems and risk management strategies. This aligns well with Rogers’ focus on reliability, scalability, and high-visibility technology services supporting millions of Canadians.

In threat intelligence and incident response roles, I regularly translated complex technical findings into actionable guidance for SOC teams and leadership. This experience strengthened my ability to balance operational detail with strategic context—an essential skill for managing security platforms that must meet both technical and organizational needs.

Rogers’ commitment to innovation and national connectivity strongly resonates with me. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute my security platform experience, operational perspective, and collaborative approach to a team responsible for protecting critical technology at scale.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Rogers Communications’ cybersecurity platform objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
