## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager, Cyber Security – Cyber Transformation and Strategy role at KPMG. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in both technical execution and strategic security thinking that aligns well with KPMG’s client-focused advisory model.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC operations into roles supporting higher-level analysis, decision-making, and security improvement initiatives. My experience spans enterprise technology environments, public-sector organizations, and client-facing security services, allowing me to understand cybersecurity challenges from both operational and governance perspectives. I have consistently worked to translate complex technical findings into clear insights that enable leaders to manage cyber risk and guide transformation efforts.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding adversary behavior and delivering intelligence that supports proactive defense and strategic planning. Previously, my time as an Incident Responder and Security Analyst reinforced the importance of resilient processes, clear communication, and alignment between security controls and organizational objectives. These experiences have shaped my approach to cybersecurity as a business-enabling function rather than solely a technical discipline.

I am particularly drawn to KPMG’s emphasis on cross-functional collaboration and helping organizations navigate cyber transformation. I am motivated by opportunities to support clients in strengthening their security posture, improving governance, and adapting to evolving threats through practical, well-informed strategies.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background and perspective can contribute to KPMG’s Cyber team.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
