## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager, Cyber Security – Cyber Transformation and Strategy role with KPMG. With over eight years of progressively responsible experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in translating technical cyber challenges into meaningful risk and strategy discussions for diverse stakeholders.

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations in strengthening their cyber posture by aligning operational security activities with broader business and risk objectives. My experience ranges from hands-on incident response and SOC operations to producing executive-level intelligence and advisory reporting that informs strategic decision-making. This combination has enabled me to understand both the tactical execution and the strategic planning required to support cyber transformation initiatives.

In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I work closely with defensive teams and leadership to contextualize threat activity, prioritize controls, and guide detection strategies. Previously, I supported public sector and enterprise organizations in managing vulnerabilities, responding to incidents, and maturing security programs in regulated environments. These experiences have reinforced the importance of governance, collaboration, and clear communication in driving sustainable cybersecurity improvements.

I am particularly drawn to KPMG’s focus on enabling clients through cyber transformation and advisory-led engagement. I am eager to contribute my operational background, risk-focused mindset, and client-oriented approach to support KPMG’s Cyber team in delivering trusted, strategic outcomes for clients.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with this role and KPMG’s broader cyber strategy objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
