## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager – Cyber Security Strategy & Governance role at KPMG. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a strong foundation in aligning cybersecurity initiatives with organizational risk, governance requirements, and strategic objectives.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC operations into senior analytical roles where my focus shifted from tactical response to strategic insight. In my current and previous roles, I have supported leadership teams by delivering clear, risk-focused security assessments, contributing to governance-aligned security improvements, and translating complex technical findings into executive-level reporting. This experience has equipped me to contribute meaningfully to client-facing engagements that require both technical credibility and strategic perspective.  

I am particularly drawn to KPMG’s emphasis on turning insight into opportunity. My background in threat intelligence and incident response has consistently required balancing operational realities with compliance frameworks, policy requirements, and long-term security strategy. I am comfortable executing structured project deliverables, collaborating across multidisciplinary teams, and supporting initiatives aligned to standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST.  

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience, analytical mindset, and practical understanding of cybersecurity governance to KPMG’s Cyber Security Services team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
