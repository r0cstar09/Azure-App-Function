## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Manager – Cyber Security Strategy & Governance role at KPMG. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in translating technical cybersecurity activities into insights that support governance, risk, and strategic decision-making.  

Throughout my career, I have supported organizations in aligning security operations with broader risk objectives. My experience spans public sector and enterprise environments, where I collaborated with operational teams, leadership stakeholders, and external partners to strengthen security posture and inform defensive priorities. I have consistently contributed to structured processes such as incident management, vulnerability programs, and intelligence-led risk assessment—key components of effective cybersecurity governance.  

In my current and previous roles, I have developed and communicated security insights tailored to both technical and executive audiences. This has enabled informed decision-making, continuous improvement of controls, and stronger alignment between security activities and organizational objectives. I am particularly drawn to KPMG’s focus on turning insight into opportunity, and I am eager to contribute my practical security background to advisory and governance-focused engagements.  

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience and professional approach align with KPMG’s Cyber Security Services team. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
