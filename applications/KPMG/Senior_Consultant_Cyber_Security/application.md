## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security position at KPMG in Toronto. With over eight years of progressive experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in hands-on cybersecurity delivery paired with the ability to communicate risk and technical insights to diverse stakeholders.

Throughout my career, I have worked in consulting, public sector, and enterprise security environments, developing a broad perspective on how cybersecurity programs support organizational objectives. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I deliver research-driven insights that help guide defensive priorities and inform decision-making at both operational and leadership levels. Previously, I supported incident response engagements for global clients and contributed to mature SOC operations within large organizations.

What attracts me to KPMG is the opportunity to apply my technical background in a consulting context—working closely with clients to translate cybersecurity challenges into practical, risk-aligned solutions. I am comfortable navigating complex environments, contributing to project deliverables, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to achieve client outcomes.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach align with KPMG’s Cyber Security practice. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
