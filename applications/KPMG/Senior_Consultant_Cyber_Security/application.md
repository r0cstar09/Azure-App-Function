Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Consultant, Cyber Security role at KPMG. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in operational cybersecurity combined with a consulting-oriented mindset focused on client outcomes and risk-based decision making.

Throughout my career, I have supported enterprise, public-sector, and client-facing environments, contributing to investigations, security assessments, and intelligence-driven defensive improvements. My experience working with consulting firms, technology vendors, and municipal organizations has allowed me to adapt quickly to diverse stakeholder needs and deliver clear, actionable security insight aligned to organizational priorities.

At One Arrow Consulting and Cisco Security, I have been directly involved in producing structured, professional deliverables intended for both technical teams and leadership. I am comfortable translating complex security findings into concise recommendations, supporting engagements where clarity, accuracy, and trust are critical.

KPMG’s focus on turning insight into opportunity strongly aligns with my professional approach. I am motivated by roles that combine technical depth, collaboration, and real-world client impact, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your Cyber Security practice in Ontario.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and perspective can support KPMG and its clients.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
