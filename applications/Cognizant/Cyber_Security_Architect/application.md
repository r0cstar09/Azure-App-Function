## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Architect role at Cognizant. With over eight years of progressive experience in security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong practitioner’s perspective to security architecture—grounded in real-world threats, incidents, and enterprise risk.  

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC, incident response, and intelligence teams to translate security events and adversary behavior into meaningful improvements in controls, detection, and design. My experience producing executive and technical reports, supporting governance-aligned security initiatives, and contributing to risk-based decisions aligns well with the review and authorship expectations around Architecture Decision Records and SARB submissions.  

In recent roles, I have increasingly focused on how intelligence, incidents, and vulnerabilities should influence architectural choices rather than isolated remediation. This perspective is reinforced by my formal training in secure cloud design and securing agentic and RAG-based GenAI systems, positioning me to contribute to responsible adoption and governance of emerging technologies.  

I am particularly drawn to Cognizant’s emphasis on balancing deep technical understanding with structured architecture governance. I would welcome the opportunity to apply my operational background, analytical mindset, and communication skills to help ensure secure, well-governed enterprise architectures.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can support Cognizant’s security architecture goals.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
