## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Architect role at Cognizant. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational foundation that naturally supports enterprise security architecture, governance, and decision-making.  

Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with detection engineers, incident responders, and leadership teams to translate real-world threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents into actionable security improvements. As a Threat Intelligence Analyst, my current role emphasizes clear documentation, structured analysis, and executive-level communication—skills that closely align with the authorship and review of Architecture Decision Records and Security Architecture Review Board submissions.  

My background in incident response and SOC operations has provided firsthand insight into how architectural decisions directly impact security outcomes. I am particularly interested in applying these lessons to support secure-by-design principles, informed risk tradeoffs, and responsible adoption of emerging technologies, including GenAI systems. My recent training related to LLMs and agentic systems further supports this interest from a security-focused perspective.  

Cognizant’s emphasis on governance, architecture, and forward-looking security aligns strongly with my professional direction. I am motivated to contribute practical, threat-informed guidance that helps organizations design resilient, well-governed security architectures.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Cognizant’s security architecture team.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
