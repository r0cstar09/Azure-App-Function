## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Architect role at Cognizant. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I have developed a practical and risk-focused perspective on how enterprise security architecture must support both operational resilience and governance requirements.  

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC analysis into roles that influence how organizations design, prioritize, and govern their security controls. As a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I routinely translate adversary behavior and emerging risks into insights that guide security strategy and long-term defensive decisions. In prior incident response and security analyst roles, I worked closely with enterprise stakeholders to assess control effectiveness, identify architectural gaps, and recommend improvements aligned with business and regulatory objectives.  

I am particularly drawn to this role’s emphasis on Architecture Decision Records, Security Architecture Review Boards, and the responsible adoption of Generative AI and agentic systems. My recent training in securing LLM-based and agentic architectures complements my operational background, enabling me to contribute meaningfully to governance discussions grounded in real-world threat and incident experience. I am comfortable producing clear, defensible security documentation for both technical and executive audiences.  

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my blend of operational insight, architectural thinking, and emerging AI security expertise to Cognizant’s security architecture team. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
