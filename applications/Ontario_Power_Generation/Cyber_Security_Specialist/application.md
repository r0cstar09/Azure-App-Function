## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist position with Ontario Power Generation. With over eight years of progressive experience in security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, risk‑focused approach to protecting large, complex environments—an approach well aligned with the needs of a critical infrastructure organization like OPG.

Throughout my career, I have supported enterprise and public‑sector environments by monitoring security events, investigating incidents, and translating technical findings into clear, actionable guidance. In my current role as a Threat Intelligence Analyst, I focus on understanding evolving adversary activity and ensuring that defensive teams are equipped with timely, relevant insights. Previously, in municipal and global enterprise contexts, I supported operational security functions such as event monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident recovery, always within regulated and highly accountable environments.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at OPG because of the organization’s role in supporting essential services for Ontarians. I value disciplined security operations, strong governance, and collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders—principles that have guided my work across SOC, IR, and intelligence roles.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and continue growing as part of OPG’s cybersecurity team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
