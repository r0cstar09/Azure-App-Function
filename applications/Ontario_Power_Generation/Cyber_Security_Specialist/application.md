## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Specialist role with Ontario Power Generation. With over eight years of professional experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational security background well suited to supporting a critical infrastructure organization.

Throughout my career, I have supported environments where system availability, safety, and risk management were key priorities. My experience spans SOC monitoring, incident investigation, vulnerability management, and intelligence‑driven security operations. Working across both public sector and enterprise consulting environments has strengthened my ability to apply security controls pragmatically while remaining aligned with policy, compliance frameworks, and organizational risk tolerance.

In my recent and current roles, I have focused on producing actionable security insights, supporting response efforts, and strengthening detection and monitoring capabilities. I am comfortable collaborating across technical teams, documenting security activity, and communicating findings to both operational staff and leadership. I value consistency, accountability, and continuous improvement—qualities I understand are essential in a highly regulated and safety‑focused organization like OPG.

I am particularly interested in this opportunity as it allows me to apply my operational cybersecurity experience in support of essential services that directly impact communities across Ontario. I would welcome the chance to contribute to OPG’s cybersecurity program and support the continued reliability and resilience of its critical systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can support Ontario Power Generation.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
