## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position with Alberta Investment Management Corporation. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat analysis, I am motivated by opportunities where defensive security directly contributes to organizational trust and long-term financial stability.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments that require continuous monitoring, disciplined incident handling, and strong alignment between security operations and organizational risk. From supporting municipal security operations to delivering enterprise-scale incident response and threat intelligence, I have developed a practical understanding of how security controls, detection, and response processes protect critical data and services.  

I am particularly drawn to AIMCo’s mandate to safeguard information that supports the financial well-being of Albertans. My background in translating technical findings into actionable insights for both operational teams and leadership aligns well with a role that supports informed decision-making and continuous improvement. I am a self-motivated analyst who values collaboration, learning, and contributing meaningfully to a mature security program.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and approach to security analysis could support AIMCo’s cyber security objectives. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
