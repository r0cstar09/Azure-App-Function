Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position at Alberta Investment Management Corporation. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in protecting organizational environments from evolving cyber threats while supporting broader business objectives.

Throughout my career, I have worked in roles that required constant vigilance, analytical thinking, and clear communication. From supporting SOC operations and incident investigations to delivering actionable threat intelligence, my focus has consistently been on helping organizations understand risk and respond effectively. I am particularly comfortable operating in regulated environments where security, reliability, and accountability are critical.

AIMCo’s mission to safeguard the financial future of Albertans strongly resonates with me. I am motivated by roles where cybersecurity directly supports public trust and organizational stability. I value continuous learning and collaboration, and I approach security challenges with a mindset grounded in both technical rigor and practical risk management.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and grow as part of AIMCo’s security team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background aligns with your needs.
