## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Systems Security Engineer position at MDA Space. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, risk-focused approach to protecting complex systems and supporting mission-critical environments.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in roles that required a strong understanding of how systems, networks, and security controls operate together. From early experience in SOC environments to more advanced incident response and intelligence-focused work, I have consistently supported the secure operation of organizational infrastructure by identifying risks, responding to incidents, and providing actionable security guidance.  

In my current and recent roles, I have supported vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident handling across enterprise environments, while also contributing to higher-level assessments of adversary behavior and defensive strategy. This combination of operational experience and analytical perspective allows me to collaborate effectively with technical teams while keeping security aligned to organizational objectives.  

MDA Space’s focus on advanced systems and mission-critical technologies strongly aligns with my interest in security engineering roles that emphasize reliability, resilience, and disciplined security practices. I would welcome the opportunity to apply my experience in supporting and strengthening secure systems within your engineering and operations teams.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background could support MDA Space’s security objectives.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
