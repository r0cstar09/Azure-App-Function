## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security – Systems Security Engineer position at MDA Space. With over eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong foundation in protecting complex systems that support critical missions and organizational objectives.

Throughout my career, I have worked in environments where system reliability, risk awareness, and operational integrity were essential. From SOC operations and incident response to producing actionable threat intelligence, my roles have required close alignment between security controls, system behavior, and real-world threats. This experience has given me a practical understanding of how security engineering supports mission-critical systems, particularly where uptime, resilience, and controlled risk are priorities.

I have extensive experience translating security findings into clear technical and executive-level guidance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. My work has consistently focused on strengthening defensive capabilities, improving detection and response readiness, and aligning security operations with established frameworks and compliance expectations.

MDA Space’s focus on advanced systems, innovation, and mission assurance strongly aligns with my background and interests. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute my security expertise to an organization supporting complex aerospace and space-based systems, where robust security engineering is integral to success.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience could support MDA Space’s security objectives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
