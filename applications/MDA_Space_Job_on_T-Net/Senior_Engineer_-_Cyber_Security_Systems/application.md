## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Engineer – Cyber Security Systems role at MDA Space. With over eight years of experience supporting security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence functions, I bring a strong operational security background well-suited to protecting complex, mission-critical systems.  

Throughout my career, I have supported environments where availability, resilience, and risk management were paramount. My experience spans public-sector infrastructure, enterprise security operations, and consulting environments, where I worked closely with engineering, operations, and leadership teams to strengthen defensive capabilities and improve security processes. I am particularly experienced in translating complex cyber threats into actionable guidance that supports system owners and decision-makers.  

MDA Space’s focus on advanced technology and mission-critical systems strongly aligns with my professional background and interests. I am motivated by roles where cybersecurity enables operational success rather than operating in isolation, and I am eager to contribute my experience to safeguarding systems that support space and geospatial missions.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can support MDA Space’s cybersecurity objectives.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
