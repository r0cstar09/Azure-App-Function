Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Engineer – Cyber Security Systems role at MDA Space. With more than eight years of experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical, operations-focused background well suited to securing complex, mission-critical systems.

Throughout my career, I have supported and improved cyber defense capabilities in enterprise and public-sector environments. I have worked hands-on with security monitoring, incident handling, vulnerability management, and intelligence-driven defense, ensuring that security controls and response processes align with organizational risk and operational priorities. My progression from SOC analyst through incident responder and threat intelligence analyst has provided me with a strong understanding of how security systems operate end to end.

MDA Space’s focus on advanced technology and mission assurance strongly aligns with my professional interests. I am particularly motivated by environments where reliability, resilience, and security are critical to operational success. I am comfortable collaborating across engineering, operations, and leadership teams to ensure security systems support broader organizational objectives.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my experience and discipline in cyber security operations to MDA Space and contribute to protecting the systems that support your space missions. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
