## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Student, Cyber Security Analyst position at MDA Space. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence roles, I bring a strong foundation in cybersecurity analysis and a genuine interest in supporting complex, mission-critical environments.

Throughout my career, I have supported security teams by monitoring enterprise environments, analyzing security events, and contributing to incident response efforts. My progression from SOC analyst roles into incident response and threat intelligence has given me a well-rounded understanding of how security monitoring, analysis, and reporting come together to protect organizations. I am particularly drawn to opportunities where cybersecurity supports innovative and high-impact missions, such as those undertaken at MDA Space.

I am highly comfortable working with structured security frameworks, producing clear documentation, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I take pride in being detail-oriented, analytical, and adaptable—qualities that I believe are essential for an early-career analyst supporting a dynamic and technically advanced organization.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute my skills while continuing to learn and grow within a forward-looking aerospace and technology environment. Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background and interests align with the goals of MDA Space.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
