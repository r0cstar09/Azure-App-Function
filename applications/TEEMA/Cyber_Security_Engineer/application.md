## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer role with TEEMA. With over eight years of experience spanning security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and risk-focused approach to protecting systems and supporting security engineering objectives.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with SOC, incident response, and security leadership teams to identify threats, validate security controls, and translate findings into actionable improvements. My recent work in threat intelligence has strengthened my ability to align real-world adversary activity with defensive requirements, while my background in security operations and incident response has grounded my perspective in operational realities and system-level impact.

I have extensive experience supporting monitored environments, contributing to vulnerability management, and producing clear technical documentation to support compliance and governance objectives. These experiences align well with a systems security engineering role focused on defining security requirements, ensuring adherence to security targets, and supporting multiple product and project teams.

I am particularly interested in this opportunity at TEEMA due to the role’s emphasis on security engineering, collaboration, and structured compliance. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my hands-on operational knowledge and analytical skills to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can support your security engineering initiatives.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
