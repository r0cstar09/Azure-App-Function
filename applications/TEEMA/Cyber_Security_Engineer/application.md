## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Engineer role with TEEMA. With over eight years of hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a practical and systems-oriented perspective to supporting secure products and projects.

Throughout my career, I have worked closely with security tooling, operational processes, and cross-functional teams to ensure systems are monitored, defended, and aligned with organizational security objectives. My background spans public-sector and enterprise environments, where adherence to policy, risk management, and structured security controls has been essential. This experience aligns well with a systems security engineering role focused on defining requirements, supporting compliance targets, and embedding security into project lifecycles.

I am particularly drawn to this role due to its emphasis on collaboration with product and project teams. My experience delivering security insights to both technical teams and leadership has enabled me to translate complex security concerns into clear, actionable guidance—an approach I would bring to TEEMA’s security engineering team.

I am eligible to work in Canada and understand the importance of regulatory compliance, controlled environments, and clearance-based work. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support TEEMA’s security objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
