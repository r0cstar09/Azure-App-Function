## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Manager – CSOC & Cyber Engineering role at Global Relay. With over eight years of progressive experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational foundation combined with the ability to align security capabilities to organizational risk and regulatory requirements.  

Throughout my career, I have supported and advanced SOC functions within both enterprise and public-sector environments. I have progressed from frontline SOC analysis to leading investigations and producing intelligence that informs executive decision-making. This background has given me a deep understanding of how effective CSOC operations depend on clear processes, well-aligned detection strategies, and close collaboration with engineering and response teams.  

In my current threat intelligence role, I focus on translating adversary behavior into actionable outcomes for SOC and incident response teams, ensuring intelligence directly supports operational and strategic goals. Previously, my incident response and SOC experience required coordinating across teams, contributing to standardized playbooks, and supporting continuous improvement—skills that closely align with managing and maturing CSOC capabilities.  

Global Relay’s focus on highly regulated environments strongly resonates with my experience supporting security operations where compliance, reliability, and evidence-driven decision-making are critical. I am motivated by the opportunity to help lead and evolve a CSOC function that protects sensitive data while enabling the business to operate with confidence.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my experience can support Global Relay’s security objectives.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
