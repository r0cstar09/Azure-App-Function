Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Manager – CSOC & Cyber Engineering role at Global Relay. With over eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational foundation combined with strategic security insight that aligns well with the needs of a highly regulated, cloud-focused organization.

Throughout my career, I have progressed from frontline SOC analysis into senior investigative and intelligence-focused roles, gaining deep exposure to how security operations function at scale. My experience spans enterprise SOC environments, incident response consulting, and intelligence-driven defense, allowing me to understand how detection, response, and engineering functions must work together to manage risk effectively.

At One Arrow Consulting, I currently produce threat intelligence that directly informs security operations, detection strategy, and executive decision-making. Previously, at Cisco Security and Symantec, I worked within global CSOC environments where consistency, escalation discipline, and collaboration between engineering and operations were critical. In public-sector work with the City of St. John’s, I supported vulnerability management, compliance-driven security controls, and incident handling within a regulated environment.

Global Relay’s focus on protecting sensitive communications data for regulated industries strongly resonates with my background. I am particularly drawn to this role’s blend of security operations leadership and cyber engineering alignment, as my career has been centered on bridging tactical security work with strategic objectives.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my operational experience, analytical perspective, and collaborative approach to Global Relay’s security leadership team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
