## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Operations Center Analyst role at Finastra. With more than eight years of experience across SOC operations, incident response, and threat intelligence, I bring a strong operational mindset well-suited to supporting a global financial technology environment.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in fast-paced security operations centers, progressing from Tier 1 monitoring to advanced investigation and response responsibilities. In these roles, I developed a disciplined approach to alert triage, escalation, and communication—ensuring that security events were handled efficiently and with appropriate risk context. My experience supporting enterprise and client-facing environments has given me a clear understanding of the importance of reliability, accuracy, and collaboration in financial-sector security operations.  

In addition to hands-on SOC and incident response experience, my current role in threat intelligence allows me to support detection and response teams with relevant adversary context. This perspective enables me to bridge operational monitoring with an understanding of emerging threats and attacker behavior, strengthening overall defensive capabilities.  

Finastra’s global reach and commitment to secure, inclusive financial services strongly align with my professional interests. I am highly motivated to contribute my experience in security monitoring, investigation, and communication to a SOC team focused on protecting critical financial systems at scale.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background can support Finastra’s security operations.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
