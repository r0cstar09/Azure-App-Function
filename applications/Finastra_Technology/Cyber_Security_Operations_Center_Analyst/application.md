## Cover Letter  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Cyber Security Operations Center Analyst role at Finastra. With over eight years of experience supporting SOC, Incident Response, and Threat Intelligence functions, I bring a strong operational security background aligned with the needs of a global financial technology organization.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in structured SOC environments monitoring, triaging, and escalating security events across endpoint and network ecosystems. My progression from Tier 1 SOC Analyst to Incident Responder and Threat Intelligence Analyst has given me a broad understanding of how detection, response, and intelligence come together to protect complex enterprise environments. This perspective enables me to support SOC operations not only by investigating alerts, but also by contextualizing threats and communicating risk clearly.  

I have supported security operations within regulated and public-sector environments, collaborated with global teams, and adhered to established frameworks and processes. I am particularly drawn to Finastra’s commitment to financial inclusion and its role in securing critical banking platforms used worldwide. I am confident my operational experience, analytical mindset, and collaborative approach would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your SOC team.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with Finastra’s security operations goals.  

Sincerely,  
Tony Muzo
